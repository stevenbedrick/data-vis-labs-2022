# Data for today

We'll use data from [Wordbank](http://wordbank.stanford.edu)- an open source database of children's vocabulary development. The tool used to measure children's language and communicative development in this database is the [MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (MB-CDI)](http://mb-cdi.stanford.edu). The MB-CDI is a parent-reported questionnaire.

# Get the data

Use this code chunk to import my cleaned CSV file:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(readr)
sounds <- read_csv("http://bit.ly/cs631-meow")

## Know your data types


* Numeric (2 subtypes)
    - Integers (`1, 50`)
    - Double (`1.5, 50.25`, `?double`)
* Character (`"hello"`)
* Factor (`grade = "A" | grade = "B"`)
* Logical (`TRUE | FALSE`)

--

```{r}
typeof(sounds$age)
typeof(sounds$sound)
typeof(sounds$sound == "meow")
```

---
# Even better: `glimpse`

```{r}
glimpse(sounds)
```


---
# `sounds` (a subset)


- `age`: child age in months
- `sound`: a string describing a type of animal sound
- `kids_produce`: the number of parents who answered "yes, my child produces this animal sound" 
- `kids_respond`: the number of parents who responded to this question at all

```{r echo = FALSE}
head(sounds) %>% knitr::kable(format = "html")
```

# Lists? Vectors?

--
What is `2`, anyway?

```{r}
typeof(2)
```

--
```{r}
length(2)
```

--

`2` is really a vector of length 1!
```{r}
is.vector(2)
```

---

# Lists? Vectors?

What about longer vectors?

--
```{r}
typeof(c(2,2))
length(c(2,2))
```

---

# Lists? Vectors?

_Atomic Vectors_ in `R` are of the same _type_ (all numbers, all logicals, etc.)

--

_Lists_ are vectors made up of multiple items of _different_ types:

```{r}
my.list <- list(c(1,2,3), c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))
my.list
```

---

# Lists? Vectors?

_Atomic Vectors_ in `R` are of the same _type_ (all numbers, all logicals, etc.)

_Lists_ are vectors made up of multiple items of _different_ types:

```{r}
my.list <- list(x=c(1,2,3), y=c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))
my.list
```

It is usually better to give names to list elements...

--

- Note: a data frame is just a list where each element is:
  - An atomic vector
  - Of uniform length

---
# Lists? Vectors?

Many operations in R are _vectorized_ (i.e., operate on an entire vector all in one go):

--

Adding a "scalar" (i.e., a vector of length 1) to a vector:

```{r}
some.numbers <- c(1,2,3)
some.numbers + 1
```

--

Adding two vectors of identical length:

```{r}
some.numbers + c(2,2,2)
```

---

# Lists? Vectors?

What if there is a length mis-match?

--

```{r}
some.numbers + c(8,8,8,8)
```

--

What's going on?

--

The shorter vector is _recycled_ until it matches the length of the larger vector:

--

```{r}
c(1,2,3,1) + c(8,8,8,8)
```

--

(Note that you may get a _warning_ from R if this happens)

--

This is how adding a scalar to a vector works, under the hood!

---

# Lists? Vectors?

Vectorization is very useful:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
y_hat <- predict(some.model)
residuals <- y_hat - my.data$y
```

--

Many things that would use _loops_ in other languages can be done using vectorized operations in R.

--

Many functions operate on vectors:

--

- `mean()`, `sum()`, etc.

--

One way to think of them : factories to convert atomic vectors of length `n` to atomic vectors of length 1!

# Data wrangling with `dplyr` 


.pull-left[
From previous:

Adding onto your arsenal of...

- `filter`

- `arrange`

- `mutate`

- `glimpse`

- `distinct`

- `count`

- `tally`

- `pull`

- `top_n`

# 3 ways to `mutate` 

1. <font color="#ED1941">Create a new variable with a specific value</font>  

1. Create a new variable based on other variables 

1. Change an existing variable

```{r}
sounds %>%

class: middle, center, inverse

#üí°

## First: 

## Arithmetic

*especially useful for* `mutate`

See:

http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#mutate-funs

---

```{r}
?Arithmetic
```

```{r include = FALSE}
math_table <- tibble::tribble(
  ~Operator, ~Description, ~Usage,
  "+", "addition", "x + y",
  "-", "subtraction", "x - y",
  "*", "multiplication", "x * y",
  "/", "division", "x / y",
  "^", "raised to the power of", "x ^ y",
  "abs", "absolute value", "abs(x)",
  "%/%", "integer division", "x %/% y",
  "%%", "remainder after division", "x %% y"
)
```


```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
knitr::kable(math_table, format = "html")
```

```{r}
5 %/% 2 # 2 goes into 5 two times with...
5 %% 2 # 1 left over
```


---
class: middle, center, inverse

#üí°

## Second: 

## Summaries

*especially useful for* `summarize`

*even more useful after a* `group_by`

See:

http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#summarise-funs



---

```{r include = FALSE}
summary_table <- tibble::tribble(
  ~Description, ~Usage,
  "sum", "sum(x)",
  "minimum", "min(x)",
  "maximum", "max(x)",
  "mean", "mean(x)",
  "median", "median(x)",
  "standard deviation", "sd(x)",
  "variance", "var(x)",
  "rank", "rank(x)"
)
```


```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
knitr::kable(summary_table, format = "html")
```

* All allow for `na.rm` argument to remove `NA` values before summarizing. The default setting for this argument is *always* `na.rm = FALSE`, so if there is one `NA` value the summary will be `NA`.

* See "Maths Functions" in the RStudio Base R Cheatsheet:
https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/base-r.pdf

* Any function that operates _on a vector_ can be used...

# Today's lab: COLORS

Specifically, discrete colors.

At the end of today's lab, you'll see an extra section on continuous colors. 

---
## But first: `shape`

--

`Shape` works like any other `ggplot` aesthetic:

--

```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
```


```{r, fig.height=4}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=bill_depth_mm, 
             shape=species, color=species)) + 
  geom_point(size=2)
```



---
## But first: `shape`

```{r echo = FALSE}
## A look at all 25 symbols
df <- data.frame(x = 1:5, 
                  y = rep(rev(seq(0, 24, by = 5)), each = 5), 
                  z = 1:25)
s <- ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  scale_shape_identity() + 
  geom_text(aes(label = z, y = y - 1)) + 
  theme_void()
s + geom_point(aes(shape = z), size = 6) 
```

---
## Shapes with `color = "hotpink"`


```{r echo = FALSE}
s + geom_point(aes(shape = z), size = 6, colour = "hotpink") 
```


---
## Shapes with `fill = "gold"`


```{r echo = FALSE}
s + geom_point(aes(shape = z), size = 6, colour = "hotpink", fill = "gold") 
```


---
## Default shape for `geom_point`

üïµüèΩ Requires spelunking into the dark corners of the `ggplot2` code on [GitHub](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/blob/master/R/geom-point.r):

--

```{r eval = FALSE}
default_aes = aes(
    shape = 19, colour = "black", size = 1.5, fill = NA,
    alpha = NA, stroke = 0.5
  )
```

So, the default for `geom_point(shape = 19)`! This is important to remember: this shape only "understands" the *color* aesthetic, but not the *fill* aesthetic.


---
## Beyond `fill`/`color` aesthetics: "Scales"

For when we need to go beyond what `fill` and `color` can do for us...

* Like adding multiple `geom_*` objects, we can add several `scale_`

  * e.g. `scale_fill_discrete()`, etc.
  
  * Time to jump to the lab worksheet!
